== Features

[role="lead"]
CallbackFilterHandler is a handler for Monolog, that has vocation to replace the FilterHandler.

*Why CallbackFilterHandler is better than standard FilterHandler ?*

It may filter records to the wrapped handler, on each standard record elements including extra data and logging context.

`FilterHandler` can just filter records and only allow those of a given list of levels through to the wrapped handler.
